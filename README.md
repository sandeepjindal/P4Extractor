<b>P4EXTRACTOR: A Simple BIG Data project</b>  
Extraction of information in various context for version management system usingHadoop
-------------------------------------------------------------
Perforce(an enterprise version management system in which users connect to a shared file repository) triggers the event whenever any change happens and collect this data and dump into HDFS(Big Data File System),then I use Hive to query on this data which has inbuilt Mappers and reducers.
On top of that I used Vaadin to provide GUI for the back end API's and used hivejdbc2 to retrieve data.
